<p>In the interest of promoting as openly as possible the discussion of the important subject of item balance on the Rift, the The Daily Rift will hereby disclose and explain the work that went into its Sept. 1 special edition article.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the The Daily Rift was invited to conduct this analysis by none other than Rift's Iterating Optimization Team (RIOT). The Sept. 1 article, as well as many other recent Rift-data services, were made for RIOT's API Challenge 2.0.
