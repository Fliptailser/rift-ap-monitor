<a id="changes-overview" class="anchor" href="#changes-overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary of 5.13 Changes</h3>

<p>Not long ago, changes were put in place that hoped to make a wider range of magical weapons (AP items) enticing for the many mages fighting on Summoner's Rift. The changes centered around the Needlessly Large Rod (NLR), a powerful and expensive component to those AP items that granted the highest amounts of magical power.

<p>By making the NLR less expensive and reducing its AP bonus, the Rift Iterating Optimization Team (RIOT) hoped to make its high-power upgrades less obligatory; correspondingly, other AP items with a focus on utility and special effects, such as Rylai's Crystal Scepter and Liandry's Torment, had their AP increased.</p>

<h3>
<a id="player-question" class="anchor" href="#player-question" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How Did Players React?</h3>

<p>In the opinion of the Rift Item Monitor, sufficient time has passed for results of this AP experiment to present themselves. Did mages change the way they built up their power? Which items rose or fell in popularity? Should the Needlessly Large Rod be renamed the Somewhat Unnecessarily Large Rod? We compiled some data from games before and after the AP item changes—view them below!</p>
